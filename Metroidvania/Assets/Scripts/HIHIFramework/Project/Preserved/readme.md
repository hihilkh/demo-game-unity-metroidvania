Scripts inside this folder are for HIHIFramework usage. The method logic and variable values of those scripts are based on the particular project, but the method and variable names should not be changed.
All the methods and variables that are not used directly by the HIHIFramework should not be created in this folder. You should create another partial class to store those methods and variables. It is to prevent the confusion when upgrading HIHIFramework.
