Note_1	Adventurer's Note 1
Note_1_Content	This cave is really mystical. There's an entrance but I can never go out through it... How many years have I been trying to get out?<br>Maybe I should find another way out.

Note_2	Adventurer's Note 2
Note_2_Content	You have probably noticed that there're some sign boards in this cave. Yes, I made them.<br>While I was finding my way out, it occurred to me that somebody else may also finding their ways out. So I'm trying to share what I have discovered about this cave.<br>Please be aware of the sign boards during your adventure!

Note_3	Adventurer's Note 3
Note_3_Content	I could feel that there's a room behind this wall. However, I couldn't find any way to go inside and had to give up.<br>But then, I found that the entry of that room is in next level! Even I was born here, I didn't know there's such a way. Maybe there're more hidden entries somewhere else.

Note_4	Adventurer's Note 4
Note_4_Content	There're some switches and secret paths around this cave. Some of them can be triggered by just walk through it, and others need some tricks.<br>I remember that once I have gone into a room that look differently from anywhere else of this cave. That room is really weird.

Note_5	Adventurer's Note 5
Note_5_Content	I know there's a treasure in that large cavity, but it is so hard to touch the switch of the hidden room... I must have missed something.<br>Could it be a hidden entry? Um... Where else is connecting to this area?<br>My intuition tells me that I must get the treasure.

Note_6	Adventurer's Note 6
Note_6_Content	Everything is ready. I defeat the guard. I have the fire. I can go out if I burn the tree away.<br>!@#$*)*&!@#$%^$%^(*&^()*&^@$#%^&*)

Ending3_Dialog1_1	Are you the one who wrote the Adventurer's notes?
Ending3_Dialog2_0	No, but I have seen those notes.

Ending3_Dialog2_2	I tried so hard to find the way out and I got the same answer of yours.
Ending3_Dialog2_3	The difference is that I have seen the complete Adventurer's notes.
Ending3_Dialog2_4	The last note mentioned that the adventurer has done some research about the tree.
Ending3_Dialog2_5	He found that the tree actually gave support to the whole cave.
Ending3_Dialog2_6	If the tree is gone, the cave will definitely collapse.
Ending3_Dialog2_7	So the adventurer finially gave up. And so do I.
Ending3_Dialog2_8	But after you told me you want to leave, I know that note will hinder you. So I erased those contents.
Ending3_Dialog3_0	......
Ending3_Dialog3_1	You are so stupid.
Ending3_Dialog4_0	So do you.
Ending3_Dialog4_1	I don't expect that you are so stupid that coming to find me even you are watching the cave collapsing.
Ending3_Dialog5_0	I can't leave you here. Let's go out together.
Ending3_Dialog6_0	It's too late. We both can't leave now.
Ending3_Dialog7_0	Anyway, thank you for finding me.
